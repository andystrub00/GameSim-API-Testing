# GameSim API Testing
 Small Repo for testing GameSim API and providing feedback. 

### Note that many of the following examples have been run in [Postman](https://www.postman.com), [Boomi](https://boomi.com/)[^1], and Python.


[^1]: Small note on Boomi requests - the default value in Boomi for the 'Accept' header does not include 'text/plain' - at least for the /ping endpoint 'Accept' must be set to include 'text/plain' (or '\*/\*')
